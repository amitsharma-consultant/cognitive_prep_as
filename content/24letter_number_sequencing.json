    {
      "text": "Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered in letter-number format?",
      "explanation": "In letter-number sequencing, the sequence should be arranged alphabetically by letters first and numerically second. Therefore, understanding that letters come before numbers in an ordered list is crucial.",

      "text": "If the sequence is R3, T1, Q2, S4, which of the following is the correct ascending order?",
      "explanation": "When sorting letter-number sequences, the letters should be sorted first. The letter sequence is R, S, Q, T; combining that with their respective numbers gives an order that should be determined based on the letters first.",
